    "Each player, in turn, must take at least one stone, but they may take more than one stone as long as they all come from the same pile. It's allowed to make a pile empty, effectively removing the pile out of the game. When a player is unable to move, the game ends. Naturally, as long as there is a stone, either player can take that stone, and thus can move. So the ending condition can be rephrased, where the game ends if there is no stone left.\n",

It is called normal condition by convention from combinatorial game theory, where a normal game gives the win to the last player making a move. In mis√®re Nim, the player unable to move wins instead; this is equivalent to the player taking the last stone losing."
