It's allowed to make a pile empty, effectively removing the pile out of the game. When a player is unable to move, the game ends. Naturally, as long as there is a stone, either player can take that stone, and thus can move. So the ending condition can be rephrased, where the game ends if there is no stone left.\n",

It is called normal condition by convention from combinatorial game theory, where a normal game gives the win to the last player making a move.
